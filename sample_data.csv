Additionally, I am a US Citzen. 

As for my background, I am a non-traditional student. I am a 35-year-old veteran and former defense contractor. Right now, I am changing careers into computer science and engineering. However, before enrolling at CU, I had a ten-year career in the US military and defense sectors. Additionally, I previously held a Top-Secret SCI security clearance. My clearance was eventually archived due to pursuing computer science at CU since 2018.

Working at Northrop Grumman is a pursuit of mine; I interviewed there for a potential sensor operator and imagery analyst position in 2014. Even though this was for a job related to my previous career, I have always wanted to re-enter the defense sector as a software engineer. Doing so at Northrop Grumman and being a part of their Quantum computing and AI projects is highly compelling. Additionally, I would be able to incorporate my previous defense industry experience when and where appropriate. 

After being accepted to the computer science dual degree BS/MS program, I decided to focus my coursework on numerical computation and AI.

I also work on Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning tools in my free time, as I currently do a side project on Generative Adversarial Networks. AI is probably my favorite class I have taken in my time at CU and would love to apply my love for the subject in something as beneficial as this project. The use of AI for good and teaching in this project is truly inspiring to me and it means a lot to me that my work would be used in the classroom. Knowing my work would make such an impact as to go for teaching students is incredible and I really look forward to the opportunity to work on this project. ","BI Inc., #1","Throughout the internships that I have worked, I have seen cloud computing become a great importance within technology and businesses. Adding GPS to an IoT device is almost crucial in today’s world as GPS is used in almost every application and interface. Being able to work within this cutting edge technology would provide great experience as well as passion that I have discovered in my internships. GPS is such an important component of today’s world and it's very exciting for me to have the opportunity to work within this field. C++, Python, and use of APIs are my greatest strengths and I believe that I would be able to apply these skills thoroughly in this project. BI Inc. also incorporates the agile methodology into their work which is what I have been using in my current internship - I have extensive experience using Rally, Miro, and other components of agile methodology.

My paper was on the topic of using Virtual Reality as a means of space exploration. There were many angles I analyzed this from: Creating simulated space as a means of setting foot where we otherwise cannot for research purposes, using similar simulated space for educational purposes, and finally using virtual reality to create user interfaces to control satellites/rovers/etc. This project isn't necessarily space relate, but I obviously have passion for virtual reality spaces, and even knowledge as to how they're used beyond gaming for helping astronauts control complex robots via digestible virtual reality iterfaces!

My passion for quantum computing comes from my freshman year of college when I was still attending DU. My intro class was about quantum mechanics in general, and one of the topics covered was quantum computing. Beyond the mind-blowing computation speeds quantum computing brings, it's conceptually amazing. It feels like the future of all things computers (far future), and I'd be extremely excited to be working with quantum computing in industry!

My main reason for wanting to work on this project is due to its focus on robotics and mapping. I am a BAM student and am also considering pursuing a PhD. One of the research areas that interests me the most is robotics/autonomous vehicles and I believe that the experience and knowledge gained from this project will help me with my research if I decide to go into this field and whether or not this field is something I really want to research. While some of the other projects also have information that would be useful in my future studies, I believe that NASA engineers are some of the best in the world and being able to work with some of them would provide me with invaluable knowledge and experience. One of the main reasons that I decided to do project instead of a thesis for senior capstone is because it would give me a better idea if I want to go into industry or research after school, and NASA/JPL would be at the top of my list of companies that I would want to work for if I did decide to ultimately go into industry.

I also believe that my skill set matches the skill requirements of this project well. Java was the first programming language that I learned and was the main one that I used throughout high school and first two years of college. While I have programmed in Java much in the past year, I believe that I should get used to it again pretty quickly after we start. For the math and geometry requirements, I have taken an algorithms and robotics course and am currently taking an advanced robotics course, which I believe should cover a lot of the math and geometry knowledge that will be needed for the project. I also got an associate's degree in math which, in conjunction with the robotics and algorithms courses, should make it easier to learn any of the other math skills that I may be missing.","BI Inc., #2","One of main reasons that I want to work on this project is because the people that I wanted to work with had a strong preference for it and I also found the project details interesting.

The open-ended nature of the task (beyond building a couple somewhat straightforward apps) means that there are a lot of possibilities and directions that this project can take, and I would really love to see how far we can take VR capabilities! I'm taking ""CSCI 5616: Introduction to Virtual Reality"" right now, and there have been some very interesting ways in which VR has been recently applied in industry, including for therapy and artistic purposes. Lately, VR has been heavily associated with gaming or training environments; however, I see VR as a great area of research with massive social impact potential.",UCAR,"There are a few reasons why I would like to work on this project:
1. I've worked with UCAR before, back in high school (I was working on a team with them to equip a drone with sensors so we could fly it over the Front Range and analyze methane and ozone levels), so I am familiar with their commitment to science education and am delighted that they want to make their curriculum more scalable.
2. I am deeply invested in both education and environmental sustainability, and I plan on pursuing opportunities in those fields during my career. This seems like a good mix of both of my main passions!
3. I've identified UI/UX and frontend development as an area in which I need to grow. I've been planning on familiarizing myself more with Javascript (in particular, Javascript frameworks like React), which is listed in this project's technical stack. This seems like a great opportunity for me to get better at frontend development without committing to an actual job (since I typically prefer backend work).",ReneCrown Wellness,"As I'm sure you've noticed by now as a running theme, I very much like projects with social impact. As someone who has known several people dear to them who struggled with eating disorders and nearly fell prey to one myself, I think building a tool to help girls pull themselves out of such a dark place would be a very good way to spend my time this year.",CU Psychology Department,"1. I have done mobile app development sporadically throughout my computing education, but I would like to become more well versed with it. Since this project's proposal specified that the app needs to be published for both iOS and Android, it's highly likely we'll use tools such as Flutter or React Native (though the current tech stack isn't specified, so it's not guaranteed), both of which I've been meaning to learn but never had the time to.
2. I would love to use this app in the future! Being able to recognize faces from racial groups I am not as familiar with has been something I've noticed myself struggling with since middle school, and I'd love to get better at it. You could say that I'd like to a be part of bringing this app to life to make sure that it actually gets to the app store. ;)
3. I'm somewhat familiar with this research since my sister was a part of this psychology lab, and I was actually going to build this app back when I first joined CU and met Josh (though the project fell through the cracks at the time). It'd be nice to bring that full circle and finish what I had *almost* started!",Saga Education,"1. After doing research about Saga Education, it's clear that they are doing amazing work and that their educational model is actually making a substantial positive impact. I especially love the fact that their model is aimed to help low-income students: as someone who came from a lower-income background myself (though I was immensely blessed with great opportunities throughout my life), education is probably the single most influential factor that brought me to where I am today. I see education as a way we as a nation can make great strides in improving lives on both an individual and structural level.
2. When I first read the project proposal, I thought, ""why not use Zoom?"" When I went searching for the answer, I found that Saga had actually documented (with great detail) the features that they needed in a video conferencing platform, and why existing solutions did not meet their needs. This struck me as very deliberate and thoughtful, which is encouraging to see in a group and engineering team. They seem like a team that would be very valuable to learn from.
3. The tech stack for this project is superb: it has half of the tools/concepts I want to learn or get better at as I prepare for industry. These are the ones on my To-Learn list that the writeup mentioned: Typescript, Javascript + React + Node, the REST framework, MongoDB, and AWS.
4. Currently, my dream is to become a software architect, and this project seems like it'd be a fantastic way to learn about the key components that go into an application, and how they interact. In particular, I like their emphasis on distributed, cloud-based systems, which is a valuable area of knowledge in industry these days.",,,,,,,,,,
